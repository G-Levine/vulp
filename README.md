# Vulp

![C++ version](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17/20-blue.svg?style=flat)

Real-time motion control for Python. Yes.

Vulp is grounded on the observation that many high-value robotic tasks require [real-time](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/real-time#English) but **not high-frequency** performance. Notably, there is [both theoretical and empirical evidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01805.pdf) that bipeds and quadrupeds can balance themselves at 5â€“15 Hz, despite being commonly implemented at 200â€“1000 Hz, with little impact to their performance. Vulp takes this idea to code by giving Python code an interface to interact at low-frequency with high-frequency actuators and simulators.

There is no dependency to install on Linux. Vulp comes with batteries included thanks to [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), which figures out the dependencies, builds and runs the Python controller above all in one go. The syntax is the same to deploy to the Raspberry Pi [on the real robot](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8b36XcCgh7s).

## Features and non-features

### Features

- Compatible with [mjbots pi3hat](https://mjbots.com/products/mjbots-pi3hat-r4-4b) and mjbots actuators
- ...

### Non-features

## Getting started

Check out [``vulp_example``](https://github.com/tasts-robots/vulp_example) to get started with a minimal Python controller and Vulp spine.

## Things to keep in mind

* Bazel's [compilation mode](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--compilation_mode) is "fastbuild" by default. Switch to ``-c opt`` for better performance when running robot experiments or simulations.

## Q and A

> Why the name "Vulp"?

[Vulp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulp#Noun_2) means "fox" in Romansh, a language spoken in the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Foxes are arguably lightweight and quite reliable in their reaction times ðŸ˜‰

> How can it be real-time in Python, with garbage collection and all?

Most of Vulp's code is written in C++ and runs at a reliable rate. The interface it exposes in Python is quite thin and runs at a reliable rate as well, up to the kilohertz at least. Now, Vulp cannot guarantee that the code on your side is real-time, but you may be surprised at how reliably operations such as neural network inference or quadratic programming can run even in pure Python. Here is for example the measured control period of a complete Python controller for [Upkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO_TkHGS0wQ) including balancing and whole-body inverse kinematics:
